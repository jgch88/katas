If he gets a spare or strike in the last (tenth) frame, 
the bowler gets to throw one or two more bonus balls, respectively. 
These bonus throws are taken as part of the same turn. 
If the bonus throws knock down all the pins, the process does not repeat: 
the bonus throws are only used to calculate the score of the final frame.

This means that there is a "bonus frame" IF AND ONLY IF the 10th frame has a 
strike or a spare.

e.g. if on the 9th frame it is a strike, then on the 10th frame it is a spare,
the 9th frame adds the two bonus points from only the spare, but the spare itself
will add the Bonus frame's one and only pin.

Strikes are the most problematic to score because they can cut across 3 different
frames, e.g. for 3 strikes in a row. The first strike scores 30.
